Trump, aki épp egy erősen az oroszoknak kedvező béketervvel házal, hosszas írásában találkozójukon.\nTrump a szokásos dolgokkal és összeesküvés-elméletekkel támadta az álomszuszéknak becézett Joe Bident, mondván, ha nem ő lett volna az elnök, nem tört volna ki a háború. Csakhogy szerinte a demokraták elcsalták a 2020-as elnökválasztást, amit amúgy számos bírósági határozat és vizsgálat megcáfolt már.\nAz amerikai elnök szerint a háború szükségtelenül folyik, értelmetlenül halnak meg emberek. Itt tért rá az alkalmatlan ukrán vezetésre, majd arról értekezett, hogy az Egyesült Államok nagy mennyiségű fegyvert ad el a NATO-nak, hogy az továbbadja Ukrajnának, amit Biden „ingyen, ingyen, ingyen” tett meg. „Isten áldja azt a sok életet, ami odaveszett ebben az emberi katasztrófában!” – zárta mondandóját.\nAz amerikai béketerv, ami 28 pontból áll, szerdán szivárgott ki a nemzetközi sajtóba. Ez voltaképp odaadná az egész Donbaszt Oroszországnak, ami megtarthatná a megszállt Krímet, délen pedig a Dnyeper mentén húzná meg az új államhatárt. Ukrajna nem lehetne a NATO tagja, nem léphetnének a területére NATO-csapatok, de valamiféle homályos amerikai biztonsági garanciát is kapna. Ezen felül az ukrán hadsereg létszámát és megfelezné a javaslat. Volodimir Zelenszkij kormánya jövő hét csütörtökig kapott határidőt, hogy válaszoljon erre. A tervről itt írtunk bővebben.\nAz ukránok nem sokkal később reagáltak is a Trump által elmondottakra. A \nMég szombaton Donald Trump arról beszélt, hogy a terv nem egy „végleges ajánlat” Ukrajna számára. A jelenlegi trumpi terv Oroszország számára elfogadható, Zelenszkij viszont leszögezte, nem fogja elárulni hazája nemzeti érdekeit.\nVasárnap több érintett ország csúcstalálkozót tart az amerikai terv miatt a svájci Genfben. A találkozón Marco Rubio amerikai külügyminiszter és Steve Witkoff, Trump különmegbízottja is részt vesz, valamint az Egyesült Királyság, Franciaország, Németország és Ukrajna biztonsági tisztviselői. Ukrajna szövetségesei nyilvánosan is elutasították a béketervet a G20-csúcstalálkozón kiadott közös nyilatkozatban. Ebben azt írták, a terv „sebezhetővé tenné Ukrajnát a támadásokkal szemben”. A G20-asok szerint a terv „további munkálatokat igényel” a határvonalakra és az ukrán hadsereg létszámára való tekintettel. A nyilatkozatot Kanada, Finnország, Franciaország, Írország, Olaszország, Japán, Hollandia, Spanyolország, az Egyesült Királyság, Németország és Norvégia írta alá.\nA békejavaslatokra pénteken Volodimir Zelenszkij ukrán elnök \naz augusztusi alaszkai csúcstalálkozón vitatták meg.\nMarco Rubio amerikai külügyminiszter a hétvégén azt mondta, hogy az ukrajnai háborúról szóló úgynevezett béketervet, amely sokak szerint Oroszországnak kedvez, az „Egyesült Államok írta”. Az amerikai külügyminiszter ezt azután mondta, hogy egy szenátorcsoport úgy nyilatkozott: Rubio azt mondta nekik, hogy az orosz–ukrán háború lezárásával kapcsolatos trumpi béketerv az egyik szenátor megfogalmazása szerint „az oroszok kívánságlistája”, és nem tényleges amerikai terv.\n**Minden fontos információ az orosz-ukrán háborúról egy helyen.**  \nKözvetítések, helyszíni tudósítások, összefoglalók, elemzések. \nTovább \nVágólapra másolva\n#Egyesült Államok#Donald Trump#béketárgyalás#orosz-ukrán háború#Volodimir Zelenszkij#Ukrajna#Oroszország\nKapcsolódó\nKülföld\nDonald Trump szerint Zelenszkij még nem olvasta az amerikai béketervet\nKülföld\nNemzetközi Atomenergia-ügynökség: Megsérült a csernobili szarkofág külső biztonsági burka\nKülföld\nPutyin véletlenül elmondta, milyen választási lehetőségük volt valójában a népszavazáson a megszállt ukrán területek lakóinak\nKülföld\nEurópai vezetők: Ki kell állnunk Ukrajna mellett, és fokoznunk kell a gazdasági nyomást Oroszországon\nGazdaság\nAz olyan országok, mint Magyarország, az európai ipar sírját ássák – a legfontosabb állítások a Kínával foglalkozó Témából\nGazdaság\nFinancial Times: Orbán vétóját megkerülve hosszabbíthatja meg az uniós többség a 210 milliárd dollárnyi orosz vagyon befagyasztását\nKövess minket Facebookon is!\nLegfontosabb \nVideó\nOrbánék hetekig magyarázták, hogy van védőpajzs, erre Trump közölte, hogy nincs\nKomplex\nMennyibe kerül nekünk a NER?\nVideó\nMagyar Péter soha nem érezheti nyeregben magát a választási rendszer torzítása miatt – 2026 élőben\nKülföld\nOrszágos botrány lett az olaszoknál abból, hogy kiemelték a hatóságok egy erdőben élő család gyerekeit\nTelex shop\nPartnereinktől\nGyerekek, állatok vagy nassolás?
